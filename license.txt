In other words...
You can use a plugin for only one person/business/project. If you want to use the purchased plugin for a different client or project then you will have to purchase another license (by purchasing the plugin again). 

What you can do with it 

    •    You can create one End Product for a client, and after you’re done, you can transfer it over to the client for any fee. This license is then transferred to the client.
    •    You can modify this plugin and manipulate it. The resulting works are subject to this license. This means no matter how much you modified, the resulting work is still subject to this license.
    •    You can download the plugin and use it without attributing back to Diziana. 

In other words...
You can do anything to plugin and use it for one project or sell it to one person/business. You can also purchase a new license if you want to use a newly-purchased or customized plugin for another person/business/project.
